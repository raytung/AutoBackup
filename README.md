Auto Backup
============
This VBScript is written to be used in conjunction with Task Scheduler.

Functions:
- Automatically backs up a desired directory
- Auto compress the backup files
- Auto maps & connects to network drive, even if logged out
- Auto purge backups after a predefined time (days)

Note:
- Current date will be the backup file's name
- A lot of the functions/implementation is mind boggling
  but I wrote this for my work at HWL. Personalized use
  version may be released at a later date.

Requirement:
- Windows 7 +
- Task Scheduler
- 7zip
